# This program is used to make a private copy of youtube videos and potentially other websites supported by youtubedl
# Furthermore it supports automatic periodic checking of channels and auto downloading. 
# It also checks if the downlaoded video already exists in the specified storage space and checks integrity of videos and redownload them if needed
# 

#
# This file contains the "Project specific funtions" this means that all functions I cannot reuse in other projects 
# like controls or checks are located inside this file.
